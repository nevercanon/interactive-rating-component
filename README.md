## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

I will include screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first Frontend Mentor project using JavaScript that I have attempted. I think I got it to work correctly but maybe not in the most efficient or realistic way. For example, I'm guessing that the first page and the thank-you page are supposed to be two different pages. However, I just used the classList in JavaScript to switch their displays once the submit button was clicked. I also didn't direct the score to be submitted anywhere, and I don't know if I was supposed to do that. I realized that I have a lot to learn in JavaScript, so I'm hoping that I can get some feedback and maybe remake this project in a better way.

I also think I could have been more efficient in my script at applying the event listener to all the number buttons. For some reason I couldn't get forEach to work on them, even though I followed some examples almost word for word. I know adding the event listener to each of them individually is probably not recommended, so I'm planning on watching a video of someone completing this project to see what they did.

I struggled a lot with the CSS on this project. It feels like some of the provided colors weren't accurate, since they didn't look like the preview images. I also had a hard time with sizing. It never looked quite right to me, especially with the sizing of the number buttons and the margins around those. I couldn't figure out how to make the container smaller while keeping the font-size at 15px. That was frustrating to me, so I'm hoping I can get some feedback on that as well.

### Continued development

This was the first in a hopefully long line of JavaScript projects for me. I know it's nowhere near perfect, but I'm going to keep doing these projects so that I can improve. I'm also hoping, as always, to increase my skill at CSS and particularly CSS Grid. I want to work on some more large layouts because those are what I tend to struggle with the most.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](http://www.alcula.com/calculators/math/ratio-calculator/) - I used this ratio calculator to figure out how to size the circular buttons.
